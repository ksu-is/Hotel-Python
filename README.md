# Hotel-Python
This is a program that allows a front desk agent to be able to check in a guest into a designated room and update their length of stay. The front desk agent will start by welcoming them to Hotel Python. They will ask the guest what it is need they and that could be checking in or creating a new reservation or asking for hotel amenities.
